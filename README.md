## Overview

### The challenge

the challanges i faced during making this project is to take so such container like we are putting our main card discription box with image contain in it, put whole card into the another container and then adjust both the container if u look closely there is another div container behind all of them which is lite in color and to adjust all of this is really frustrating for me who is just bigger in the css now. but these challanges are help you to explore and learn some now things.
